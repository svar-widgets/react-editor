[SVAR React Editor](https://svar.dev/react/editor/) is a flexible component for creating custom edit forms for structured data. It helps you compose edit panels using various form controls.

Whether embedded inline, shown as a sidebar, or opened as a modal dialog, the Editor offers an intuitive way to manage data in CMS dashboards, info cards, user profiles, or can be attached to any UI element that needs editing functionality.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@svar-ui/react-editor";

```

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.svar.dev/react/editor/getting_started/) to quickly set up and begin using SVAR Editor component in your React projects.

### :computer: How to Modify

Typically, you don't need to modify the code. However, if you wish to do so, follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Note that this project is a monorepo using `yarn` workspaces, so npm will not work
2. Start the project in development mode with `yarn start`

### :white_check_mark: Run Tests

To run the test:

1. Start the test examples with:
   ```sh
   yarn start:tests
   ```
2. In a separate console, run the end-to-end tests with:
   ```sh
   yarn test:cypress
   ```
